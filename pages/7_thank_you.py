    Dear Visitor,

    Thank you for spending your time with this Raksha Bandhan app.

    It was created with a lot of care and intention â€” to celebrate a bond thatâ€™s full of love, chaos, fake insults, and real loyalty.

    Whether you tied a virtual rakhi, wrote a heartfelt letter, or laughed your way through the sibling quiz â€” I hope this experience brought a genuine smile to your face.

    May this Raksha Bandhan bring you peace, joy, and unforgettable memories. And may the sibling bond you share â€” or remember â€” stay just as weird and wonderful.

    With warmth and love,  
    **Prajwal**
    """
